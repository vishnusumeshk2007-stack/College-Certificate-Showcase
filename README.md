# Celestial Campus: Student Achievement Verification & Showcase Platform
> **Digital Portfolio + College Leaderboard System**
 
A modern web application built with **Flask, SQLite, Bootstrap 5, Vanilla JavaScript, Chart.js, and ReportLab**. The platform allows students to upload their co-curricular and academic honors (hackathons, research publications, internships, sports, cultural feats, certifications), while faculty and administrators verify, remark, score, and showcase them across campus.

## 🔄 Production Readiness: Switching to MySQL
To transition from SQLite to MySQL in a production deployment:
1. Install the MySQL driver:
   ```bash
   pip install pymysql cryptography
   ```
2. Set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable:
   ```bash
   export DATABASE_URL="mysql+pymysql://user:password@host:3306/celestial_db"
   ```
   No changes to model code or SQL queries are required thanks to the SQLAlchemy ORM abstraction!
